## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### you are in the repository of Micha(el)

I am a Business Computer Scientist with a global and multidisciplinary background. I have a passion for the environment (plants, sea, nature), data and strive to make the world more sustainable using ML and Deep Learning. You can also find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michajs/).

### Here are my technical skills:
* Programming: Python, R, SQL
* Data Analysis & Visualization: Numpy, Pandas, Plotly
* Machine Learning & Deep Learning: Keras, TensorFlow, PyTorch
* Data Acquisition: APIs & Webscraping 

Although ML algorithmes like random forest or UMAP (dimensionality reduction) are interesting, my passion is with CNNs and images. Stay tuned for my next project!

âš¡ Fun fact: I model data, but also clay. 

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects regarding the protection of (rain) forest and decarbonisation.
